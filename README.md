# levy-distribution-cpp

By Neel Tangella and the Computational Systems Biology at the University of Southern California. 




Header-only library to sample along a l√©vy distribution. More functionality will be added later. 

Here we use the levy distribution pdf and rejection sampling to generate
random variates along the levy distribution. Took too long to find a package
that will do this in c++ so I tried to make it myself.
