# levy-distribution-cpp

By Neel Tangella for use by the Computational Systems Biology Lab at the University of Southern California. 

---WORK IN PROGRESS---
Header-only library to sample along a l√©vy distribution. More functionality will be added later. As well as testing docs.

Here we use the levy distribution pdf and rejection sampling to generate
random variates along the levy distribution. Took too long to find a package
that will do this in c++ so I tried to make it myself.
